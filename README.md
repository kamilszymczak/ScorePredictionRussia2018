Web App where user logins (or registers if does not have an account yet). Once logged in user can make own predictions of each World Cup 2018 football match result.
User can check the Leaderboard to see what place they currently hold. Click username in leaderboard to see the history of user's predictions in detail.

Match disappears from Prediction Page 30 minutes before the start of the match.
When user enters a score for a particular match the system checks the current time server side to make sure no new prediction can be made 30 minutes before the start of the match. (Alternative Validation if user wants to outplay the system and keep the page open after 30 minutes to match)
